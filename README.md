# Stampede
A game made in Unity

In this project I've focussed on making a compelling AI system for the creatures you interact with. I really liked [Quill18's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc86es4YOoc) method, which uses WeightedDirections generated by different AI scripts and combines them based on weight to produce a single movement. I added intentions other than movement, such as eating and attacking.
